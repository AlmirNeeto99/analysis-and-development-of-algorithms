# Analysis and Development of Algorithms

This repository holds the exercises for the PGCC006 - Analysis and Development of Algorithms Course at State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS) for Master of Science Program.

## Structure

Each folder contains scripts and notebooks solving each problem proposed by the professor.

## Dependencies

All exercises were solved using the following dependencies:

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn

If you are running locally, you should probably install *ipykernel* for executing it.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Professor Jo√£o B. Rocha-Junior for providing such important techniques and knowledge.
